## For Developers

This section provides an overview of the code structure and functionality for developers.

### Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

1. `OrderRequest`: This class is responsible for validating the incoming order request. It contains validation rules for the request data.

2. `CanMakeOrderRule`: This class is a rule that checks the quantity of products in the order request against the available quantity in the database.

3. `OrderController`: This class is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests related to orders. It calls the `OrderService` to perform the necessary operations.

4. `OrderService`: This class is responsible for coordinating the business logic related to orders. It calls the `OrderRepository` to interact with the database.

5. `OrderRepository`: This class is responsible for interacting with the database to retrieve and store order data.

6. `ProductsImport`: This class is responsible for importing product data from a CSV file. The file must be stored in the `storage/app/public` directory.

7. `ProductSeeder`: This class is responsible for seeding the database with initial product data.

8. `ProductObserver`: This class observes the creation of new products and calculates the `stock_notification_limit` for each product.

9. `CheckProductsQuantityLimitNotification`: This class is responsible for sending an email notification to the merchant when the stock quantity of a product reaches its limit.
